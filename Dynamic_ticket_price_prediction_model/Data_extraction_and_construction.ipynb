    "## Building a Targeted Dataset for Ticket Price Prediction  \n",
    "\n",
    "To develop a predictive model for ticket pricing, I engineered a dataset by integrating features that significantly influence price fluctuations. Key variables included event popularity metrics, supporting artist prominence scores, proximity to the event date (days until event), and additional determinants of consumer demand. The dataset was constructed by requesting data from APIs, extracting relevant features, and merging them using shared identifiers to ensure consistency and usability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Pipeline and Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "The data pipeline utilized multiple APIs to extract and preprocess relevant features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spotify API**: Retrieved structured data on artist popularity indices, years active, and associated genres for encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reddit API**: Scraped real-time mentions of artists, applying filtering logic to capture relevant mentions from the current day to gauge social buzz.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ticketmaster API**: Collected granular details on ticket listings, event timelines, and venue attributes for feature engineering."
