Yesterday,Yesterday by The Beatles,"109 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeEspañolPortuguêsDeutschYesterday Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Verse 2]
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

[Bridge]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Verse 3]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Bridge]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Let It Be,Let It Be by The Beatles,"148 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolDeutschLet It Be Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Verse 2]
And when the broken-hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer
Let it be
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be

There is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow
Let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be, yeah

In My Life,In My Life by The Beatles,"74 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolDeutschIn My Life Lyrics[Verse 1: John Lennon, John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
There are places I remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain

[Bridge: John Lennon, John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

[Verse 2: John Lennon, John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

[Bridge: John Lennon, John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

Hey Jude,Hey Jude by The Beatles,"133 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolHey Jude Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

[Verse 2]
Hey, Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
