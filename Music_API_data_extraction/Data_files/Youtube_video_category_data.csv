Beatles 1+ Deluxe Edition Celebrates the Sight & Sound of The Beatles in 50 Films & Videos 

London – September 15, 2015 – After The Beatles stopped touring, and because travelling around the globe to promote new releases was impossible, the band increasingly made what could be described as “mini movies”. These pioneering promotional films and videos helped to define the way we have come to watch music, not least because The Beatles approached filming with the same ease and innovative spirit they brought to the recording studio, exploring new creative possibilities with infectious delight. Showcasing the band’s filmed work to accompany their 27 No.1, U.K. and U.S. singles, The Beatles 1 is newly restored and expanded in multiple configurations for global release on November 6 by Apple Corps Ltd/UMG.

The 27-track CD/DVD and CD/Blu-ray pairs beautifully restored videos for each song, with new stereo and 5.1 Dolby Digital and DTS HD surround audio mixes. The brand new Beatles 1+ celebrates their career in over 200 minutes through 50 promotional films and videos. This includes the 27 No.1s, with the restored videos, along with a second disc of 23 videos, including alternate versions, as well as rarely seen and newly restored films and videos; all include new audio mixes in deluxe CD/2-DVD and CD/2-Blu-ray packages. The 27-track audio CD is also being made available with new stereo mixes. A 2 LP, 180-gram vinyl package will follow.

The new editions of The Beatles 1 have been made possible following extensive research, and restoration of the original promo films, classic television appearances and other carefully selected videos spanning the band’s history. Apple Corps dug deep into The Beatles’ vaults to select a broad range of films and videos for their rarity, historical significance and quality of performance. An 18-person team of film and video technicians and restoration artists was assembled by Apple Corps to undertake painstaking frame-by-frame cleaning, colour-grading, digital enhancement and new edits that took months of dedicated, ‘round-the-clock work to accomplish.

The result is a visual run down of The Beatles’ number one records, as well as the additional tracks on the bonus disc of Beatles 1+ that show the band in previously unseen standards of clarity and quality; many of the films and videos have never before been commercially released, in whole or in part.

Beatles 1 and Beatles 1+ offers the restored films, including 35mm negatives scanned in 4K and digitally restored with new stereo and 5.1 surround audio remixes, produced from the original analogue tapes by the GRAMMY® winning team of Giles Martin with Sam Okell at Abbey Road Studios. For four of the videos, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr have provided exclusive audio commentary and filmed introductions, respectively. The 1+ Deluxe Edition, presented in an expanded 124-page illustrated hardcover book includes ‘an appreciation’ of The Beatles’ ground-breaking films and videos by music journalist and author Mark Ellen and extensive, detailed track/video annotation by music historian and author Richard Havers. 

“These videos and films are spectacular reminders of the era we lived in. They also rock!” – Paul McCartney

""I think it’s really interesting to see the videos we made, some of them incredible and some of them really incredible.  How else would we have got to sit on a horse?"" – Ringo Starr

Between 1962 and 1970, The Beatles released 27 No.1 hit singles in the U.S. and the U.K. In 2000, these timeless songs were collected for The Beatles 1, which topped the charts in 35 countries and became that decade’s bestselling album worldwide. 15 years later, 1 is revisited for this entirely new, visually-inspired presentation. 

It’s The Beatles, as you’ve never seen them before.

vefJAtG-ZKI,Yellow Submarine Original Trailer - 1968 (Beatles Official),10,The Beatles,"Yellow Submarine Feature Film Restored For May Release on DVD and Blu-ray
Once upon a time...or maybe twice...there was an unearthly paradise called Pepperland...

The Beatles' classic 1968 animated feature film, Yellow Submarine, has been digitally restored for DVD and Blu-ray release on May 28 (May 29 in North America). The film's songtrack album will be reissued on CD on the same date.

Currently out of print, the film has been restored in 4K digital resolution - all done by hand, frame by frame.

John Lasseter, Chief Creative Officer, Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios writes ""As a fan of animation and as a filmmaker, I tip my hat to the artists of Yellow Submarine, whose revolutionary work helped pave the way for the fantastically diverse world of animation that we all enjoy today.""",2012-03-20T15:08:19Z
Tb83rbm0IVI,The Beatles: Get Back | Official Trailer | Disney+,10,The Beatles,"The official trailer for #TheBeatlesGetBack is here! The Disney+ original docuseries, directed by
Peter Jackson, will be arriving on Disney+ just in time for the Thanksgiving holiday. Made
entirely from never-before-seen, restored footage, it provides the most intimate and honest
glimpse into the creative process and relationship between John, Paul, George, and Ringo ever
filmed.  Be sure to check them both out, and don’t forget to watch “The Beatles: Get Back” when
it rolls out over three days, November 25, 26, and 27, 2021, exclusively on Disney+.

Directed by three-time Oscar®-winning filmmaker Peter Jackson (“The Lord of the Rings” trilogy,
“They Shall Not Grow Old”), “The Beatles: Get Back” takes audiences back in time to the band’s
January 1969 recording sessions, which became a pivotal moment in music history. The
docuseries showcases The Beatles’ creative process as they attempt to write 14 new songs in
preparation for their first live concert in over two years. Faced with a nearly impossible deadline,
the strong bonds of friendship shared by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and
Ringo Starr are put to the test. The docuseries is compiled from nearly 60 hours of unseen
footage shot over 21 days, directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg in 1969, and from more than 150
hours of unheard audio, most of which has been locked in a vault for over half a century.
Jackson is the only person in 50 years to have been given access to this Beatles treasure trove,
all of which has now been brilliantly restored.  What emerges is an unbelievably intimate portrait
of The Beatles, showing how, with their backs against the wall, they could still rely on their
friendship, good humor, and creative genius. While plans derail and relationships are put to the
test, some of the world’s most iconic songs are composed and performed. The docuseries
features – for the first time in its entirety – The Beatles’ last live performance as a group, the
unforgettable rooftop concert on London’s Savile Row, as well as other songs and classic
compositions featured on the band’s final two albums, Abbey Road and Let It Be.

An exciting new collaboration between The Beatles and Jackson presented by The Walt Disney
Studios in association with Apple Corps Ltd. and WingNut Films Productions Ltd., “The Beatles:
Get Back” is directed by Peter Jackson, produced by Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono
Lennon, Olivia Harrison, Peter Jackson, Clare Olssen (“They Shall Not Grow Old”) and
Jonathan Clyde (“Eight Days a Week”), with Apple Corps’ Jeff Jones (“Eight Days a Week”) and
Ken Kamins (“The Hobbit” trilogy) serving as executive producers. Jabez Olssen (“Rogue One:
A Star Wars Story”) serves as the film’s editor, the music supervisor is Giles Martin
(“Rocketman”), Michael Hedges (“The Adventures of Tintin”) and Brent Burge (“The Hobbit”
trilogy) serve as the series re-recording mixers, and the music is mixed by Giles Martin and Sam
Okell (“Yesterday”).

KgFTpwB_uII,Now And Then – The Last Beatles Song (Short Film Trailer),10,The Beatles,"Now and Then's eventful journey to fruition took place over five decades and is the product of conversations and collaborations between the four Beatles that go on to this day. The long mythologised John Lennon demo was first worked on in February 1995 by Paul, George and Ringo as part of The Beatles Anthology project but it remained unfinished, partly because of the impossible technological challenges involved in working with the vocal John had recorded on tape in the 1970s. For years it looked like the song could never be completed. But in 2022 there was a stroke of serendipity. A software system developed by Peter Jackson and his team, used throughout the production of the documentary series Get Back, finally opened the way for the uncoupling of John’s vocal from his piano part. 

As a result, the original recording could be brought to life and worked on anew with contributions from all four Beatles. This remarkable story of musical archaeology reflects The Beatles’ endless creative curiosity and shared fascination with technology. It marks the completion of the last recording that John, Paul and George and Ringo will get to make together and celebrates the legacy of the foremost and most influential band in popular music history.

uOlwwoZLoKE,Yellow Submarine US Theatrical Trailer - 2018 (Beatles Official),10,The Beatles,"THE BEATLES’ YELLOW SUBMARINE 
IN THEATERS ACROSS NORTH AMERICA THIS JULY TO CELEBRATE THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY

Restored 4K Theatrical Version With Remixed 5.1 Stereo Surround Sound 

Once upon a time…or maybe twice…there was an unearthly paradise called Pepperland…

NEW YORK / LONDON / LOS ANGELES – APRIL 03, 2018 – Abramorama announced today a deal with Apple Corps Ltd. and Universal Music Group (UMG) to theatrically release The Beatles’ classic 1968 animated feature film, Yellow Submarine, across North America this July in celebration of its 50th anniversary. Abramorama, Apple Corps Ltd. and UMG have teamed to give Beatles fans of all ages the opportunity to come together and share in this visually stunning movie and soundtrack.  Abramorama originally partnered with Apple Corps, Imagine Entertainment, White Horse Pictures, StudioCanal and UMG’s Polygram Entertainment on the Ron Howard documentary The Beatles:  Eight Days a Week – The Touring Years. Abramorama has a proven track record in the music-driven film space, partnering numerous times with Neil Young, Pearl Jam and Green Day and now once again with Apple Corps Ltd.

Yellow Submarine was restored in 4K digital resolution by Paul Rutan Jr. and his team of specialists at Triage Motion Picture Services and Eque Inc.  The film’s songs and score were remixed in 5.1 stereo surround sound at UMG’s Abbey Road Studios by music mix engineer Peter Cobbin. Due to the delicate nature of the hand-drawn original artwork, no automated software was used in the digital clean-up of the film’s restored photochemical elements.  This was all done by hand, frame by frame. 

Richard Abramowitz, CEO of Abramorama said, “We’re thrilled to have the privilege of bringing Yellow Submarine back to the big screen so that 3 generations of happy Beatles fans can enjoy the ground-breaking animation and classic tunes and that have long been part of our collective cultural DNA.”

Directed by George Dunning, and written by Lee Minoff, Al Brodax, Jack Mendelsohn and Erich Segal, Yellow Submarine began its voyage to the screen when Brodax, who had previously produced nearly 40 episodes of ABC’s animated Beatles TV series, approached The Beatles’ manager Brian Epstein with a unique vision for a full-length animated feature.  

Yellow Submarine, based upon a song by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, is a fantastic tale brimming with peace, love, and hope, propelled by Beatles songs, including “Eleanor Rigby,” “When I’m Sixty-Four,” “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,” “All You Need Is Love,” and “It’s All Too Much.”  When the film debuted in 1968, it was instantly recognized as a landmark achievement, revolutionizing a genre by integrating the freestyle approach of the era with innovative animation techniques. 

Inspired by the generation’s new trends in art, the film resides with the dazzling Pop Art styles of Andy Warhol, Martin Sharp, Alan Aldridge and Peter Blake. With art direction and production design by Heinz Edelmann, Yellow Submarine is a classic of animated cinema, featuring the creative work of animation directors Robert Balser and Jack Stokes with a team of animators and technical artists.

MM7v61MvHco,🎶  We’ve got a feeling 🎶  you won’t want to miss this.,10,The Beatles,"Stream The Beatles: Get Back now on  @disneyplus  

Made entirely from never-before-seen, restored footage, it provides the most intimate and honest glimpse into the creative process and relationship between John, Paul, George, and Ringo ever filmed.  

“The Beatles: Get Back” takes audiences back in time to the band’s January 1969 recording sessions, which became a pivotal moment in music history. The docuseries showcases The Beatles’ creative process as they attempt to write 14 new songs in preparation for their first live concert in over two years. Faced with a nearly impossible deadline, the strong bonds of friendship shared by John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr are put to the test. The docuseries is compiled from nearly 60 hours of unseen footage shot over 21 days, directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg in 1969, and from more than 150 hours of unheard audio, most of which has been locked in a vault for over half a century.

Jackson is the only person in 50 years to have been given access to this Beatles treasure trove, all of which has now been brilliantly restored.  What emerges is an unbelievably intimate portrait of The Beatles, showing how, with their backs against the wall, they could still rely on their friendship, good humor, and creative genius. While plans derail and relationships are put to the test, some of the world’s most iconic songs are composed and performed. The docuseries features – for the first time in its entirety – The Beatles’ last live performance as a group, the unforgettable rooftop concert on London’s Savile Row, as well as other songs and classic compositions featured on the band’s final two albums, Abbey Road and Let It Be.",2022-01-14T15:55:21Z

According to NME, March 8th 1963:   ""Things are beginning to move for the Beatles, the r-and-b styled British group. The disc 'Please Please Me' follows closely on the heels of their first hit 'Love Me Do' written by group members John Lennon and Paul McCartney.  It looks like a bright future for the Beatles, but knowing them I don't think they'll let it go to their heads.""

As recalled by George Martin ""Please Please Me was done in a day - we started at 10 o'clock in the morning finished at 11 at night, and that was the record made.""

sBiq39gfBh4,BEATLES ’64 - watch the new trailer.,10,The Beatles,"Journey back to 1964 and experience Beatlemania like never before. 

From producer Martin Scorsese and director David Tedeschi, stream Beatles '64, an original documentary, only on @disneyplus November 29.

The film captures the electrifying moment of The Beatles’ first visit to America.  On February 7, 1964, The Beatles arrived in New York City to unprecedented excitement and hysteria. From the instant they landed at Kennedy Airport, met by thousands of fans, Beatlemania swept New York and the entire country. Their thrilling debut performance on The Ed Sullivan Show captivated more than 73 million viewers, the most watched television event of its time. Beatles ’64 presents the spectacle, but also tells a more intimate behind the scenes story, capturing the camaraderie of John, Paul, George, and Ringo as they experienced unimaginable fame.

The film includes rare footage filmed by pioneering documentarians Albert and David Maysles, beautifully restored in 4K by Park Road Post in New Zealand. The live performances from The Beatles’ first American concert at the Washington, DC Coliseum and their Ed Sullivan appearances were demixed by WingNut Films and remixed by Giles Martin. Spotlighting this singular cultural moment and its continued resonance today, the music and footage are augmented by newly filmed interviews with Paul and Ringo, as well as fans whose lives were transformed by The Beatles.

Beatles ’64 is directed by David Tedeschi and produced by Martin Scorsese, Margaret Bodde, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Olivia Harrison, Sean Ono Lennon, Jonathan Clyde, and Mikaela Beardsley, with Jeff Jones and Rick Yorn serving as executive producers.

sclfhlScwkk,"The Beatles Arrive In New York for their First US Visit, 7th February 1964",10,The Beatles,"Paul: ""There were millions of kids at the airport, which nobody had expected. We heard about it in mid-air. There were journalists on the plane, and the pilot had rang ahead and said, 'Tell the boys there's a big crowd waiting for them.' We thought, 'Wow! God, we really have made it.' ""

On Friday 7th February, 1964, The Beatles landed at Kennedy airport and were immediately thrust into their now-legendary first press conference there. The place was heaving with rabid reporters, seasoned journalists and camera crews from all over the world. 

From there, they took a limo to the Plaza Hotel, where they stayed during their time in NYC. The Beatles' suite was a hub of activity - a place where they anticipated, prepared for and then relaxed after each of  the milestone events that they were experiencing in such quick succession. They would await phone calls from journalists or to receive news of how their songs were doing in the charts; they gave in-person interviews, there, and watched themselves on television. Often, they would call into radio stations to request their favourite records. 

Bit by bit, they were getting a sense of 'America'. Still, they were tired. It had been a long trip - a long day. And George, it turns out, was coming down with flu...

THE BEATLES RING IN THE HOLIDAYS WITH ‘THE CHRISTMAS RECORDS’ LIMITED EDITION SEVEN-INCH VINYL BOX SET TO BE RELEASED DECEMBER 15

Preorder The Beatles’ limited edition The Christmas Records box set:  http://TheBeatles.lnk.to/ChristmasRecords

The Beatles’ annual holiday tradition of recording jolly Christmas messages for fan club members was an important part of the band’s relationship with their most ardent supporters, affectionately referred to by them as “Beatle People.” 

Spanning 1963 to 1969, The Beatles’ holiday recordings were originally pressed on flexi discs and mailed to fan club members each December. Never released beyond the fan club until now, The Beatles’ seven holiday messages have been newly pressed on a rainbow of seven-inch colored vinyl singles for The Christmas Records box set, to be released worldwide on December 15. The limited edition collection presents each vinyl single with its original flexi disc sleeve artwork, accompanied by a 16-page booklet with recording notes and reproductions of the fan club’s National Newsletters, which were mailed to members with the holiday flexi discs.

nHikyT0Ffaw,George Harrison & Friends' The Concert For Bangladesh Now Streaming Worldwide,10,The Beatles,"Los Angeles | London — August 9, 2024 — For the first time, The Concert for Bangladesh, the GRAMMY® Award-winning album from George Harrison, Ravi Shankar & friends, is now available for streaming across all major digital music providers worldwide.

The Concert for Bangladesh was the first major music benefit of its kind. Two sold out concerts at New York’s Madison Square Garden brought together an extraordinary assemblage of major artists collaborating for a common humanitarian goal – setting the precedent that music could be used to serve a higher cause. 

With its triple album boxset and feature film, The Concert for Bangladesh has generated millions of dollars for UNICEF and raised awareness for the organization around the world. To quote the former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, “George and his friends were pioneers.”

By August 1971, when George Harrison, Ravi Shankar & friends took the stage to play The Concert for Bangladesh, 10 million East Pakistani refugees had fled over the border into India, facing significant challenges, including the threat of hunger and disease. Up to that point, little public attention had been drawn to the crisis in East Pakistan/Bangladesh. Few people outside the region were aware of what was happening to these refugees or how to help those affected.

George organized the two groundbreaking concerts to direct global attention to the unfolding humanitarian crisis and raise funds for UNICEF’s work with the refugees. He assembled an all-star line-up of fellow artists including Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr, Leon Russell, Billy Preston, and, of course, Ravi Shankar:
“The musicians were great. I mean they completely put down their own egos to play together and to do something because the whole vibe of that concert was that it was something bigger than the lot of us.”
– George Harrison
 
Now, over 50 years later, children in Bangladesh continue to face risks from ongoing violence and unrest. But UNICEF's presence remains – ensuring every child is healthy and protected – and The George Harrison Fund for UNICEF continues the concert's legacy by providing support for critical UNICEF programs not only in Bangladesh, but anywhere children are in need.

The album is packed with astonishing performances and makes for a rousing listening experience. The historic collection, now celebrating over 50 years, also contains a bonus track – the original studio version of George’s song “Bangla Desh”, released as a single in July 1971.

All net proceeds (after taxes), will be donated to the George Harrison Fund for UNICEF at the U.S. Fund for UNICEF. For more information visit www.georgeharrisonfundforunicef.org. The U.S. Fund for UNICEF does not endorse any brand or product.

About this song, Paul mused, ‘I think that’s one of the nice things about the English language, that you can take things in multiple ways, “Your day breaks” works on the level of both “your day begins” and “your day is broken” and “She makes up” is working in a couple of ways: putting on your make up and making up after an argument.’
