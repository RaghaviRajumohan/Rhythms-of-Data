# Rhythms of Data

## Introduction

The music industry, once driven by unquantifiable instincts and an intimate discovery process, has transformed in the digital age. With the growth of social media and streaming platforms, discovering new artists and creating music has become more accessible, democratizing an industry that once relied on gatekeepers and gut feelings. Today, vast datasetsâ€”from streaming numbers and fan interactions to song characteristicsâ€”provide insights that were previously left to intuition.

While creativity remains at the heart of music, numbers are now essential for navigating its evolving landscape. Data analytics allows us to understand audience preferences, predict trends, and make strategic decisions grounded in evidence. In this modern music industry, blending artistic intuition with analytical precision is key to maximizing a songâ€™s reach and shaping an artistâ€™s career, proving that data has become an invaluable partner in the creative process.

These projects highlight the diverse applications of data science within the music industry, from analyzing streaming patterns and fan engagement to understanding the factors that contribute to a songâ€™s popularity. By leveraging data, we can make well-informed decisions that enhance an artist's reach, optimize promotional strategies, and ultimately foster a deeper connection between artists and audiences. In a world where creativity and data converge, these insights help shape the future of music with precision and purpose.

|---|---|
| ðŸŽ¶ [Music Streams Prediction Model](https://github.com/RaghaviRajumohan/Rhythms-of-Data/tree/main/Music_Streams_Prediction_Model) | This project builds regression models to predict music streaming numbers by analyzing key factors that drive listener engagement, helping to understand and anticipate streaming trends. ![Python(https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-gray?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)![Regression](https://img.shields.io/badge/Regression-gray?style=for-the-badge)![Predictive Modeling](https://img.shields.io/badge/Predictive%20Modeling-gray?style=for-the-badge)| 
| ðŸŽ¸ [Music Genre Classification Model](https://github.com/RaghaviRajumohan/Rhythms-of-Data/tree/main/Music_Genre_Classification_Model) | This project leverages machine learning techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbors, to classify music into genres based on detailed audio features. By examining aspects like MFCCs, spectral centroid, and rhythmic properties, the model categorizes music with precision and helps in enhancing personalized recommendations, playlist curation, and trend analysis in the music industry. |
| ðŸŽ¤ [YouTube Sentiment Analysis for Comments](https://github.com/RaghaviRajumohan/Rhythms-of-Data/tree/main/Youtube_Comments_Sentiment_Analysis) | This project uses natural language processing to assess sentiment in YouTube comments on Doechii's music videos. Sentiment scores were integrated into a regression model to predict view counts, analyzing the relationship between audience sentiment and video performance metrics. The YouTube API was used to collect data on comments, likes, views, and other engagement metrics directly from Doechii's official YouTube channel.|
| ðŸ“Š [Music API Data Extraction](https://github.com/RaghaviRajumohan/Rhythms-of-Data/tree/main/Music_API_data_extraction) | This project integrates multiple APIs, including Spotify, Genius,YouTube, Discogs, and Ticketmaster, to create specialized datasets tailored to key research questions in the music industry. By structuring artist, streaming, sentiment, and event data, it enables trend analysis and data-driven insights for artist management and marketing. |
