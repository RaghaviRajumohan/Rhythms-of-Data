# Rhythms of Data

## Introduction

 The music industry has undergone a profound transformation in the digital age. Once reliant on unquantifiable instincts and intimate discovery processes, it now thrives on the power of data. Social media and streaming platforms have democratized the discovery and creation of music, making it more accessible than ever before. This shift has introduced vast datasets‚Äîranging from streaming numbers and fan interactions to song characteristics‚Äîthat offer insights previously guided by intuition alone.

While creativity remains at the heart of music, numbers are now essential for navigating its evolving landscape. Data analytics allows us to understand audience preferences, predict trends, and make strategic decisions grounded in evidence. In this modern music industry, blending artistic intuition with analytical precision is key to maximizing a song‚Äôs reach and shaping an artist‚Äôs career, proving that data has become an invaluable partner in the creative process.

These projects highlight the diverse applications of how ***data science can act as a catalyst for creativity***. By leveraging data, we can streamline critical aspects of the industry‚Äîsuch as identifying emerging talent, predicting market trends, and personalizing listener experiences‚Äîunlocking new opportunities for growth  and ultimately fostering a deeper connection between artists and audiences. In this age of convergence between art and analytics, the future of music is being shaped with precision, purpose, and passion.


| Project Name | Description |    
|---|---|
| üé∂ [Music Streams Prediction Model](https://github.com/RaghaviRajumohan/Rhythms-of-Data/tree/main/Music_Streams_Prediction_Model) | This project uses regression models to predict music streaming numbers by analyzing features like energy, danceability, and audience engagement metrics. It explores interactions and quadratic relationships to capture complex dynamics between song attributes and popularity, providing deeper insights into streaming trends and listener behavior.| 
| üéüÔ∏è [Dynamic Concert Ticket Price Prediction Model](https://github.com/RaghaviRajumohan/Rhythms-of-Data/tree/main/Dynamic_ticket_price_prediction_model)  | This project predicts concert ticket prices dynamically using features like artist popularity, event timing, and ticket availability. By leveraging regression models such as OLS, Ridge, Lasso, and Random Forest, the project identifies key factors influencing ticket prices and provides actionable insights for optimizing revenue and customer satisfaction. |
| üé∏ [Music Genre Classification Model](https://github.com/RaghaviRajumohan/Rhythms-of-Data/tree/main/Music_Genre_Classification_Model) | This project leverages machine learning techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbors, to classify music into genres based on detailed audio features. By examining aspects like MFCCs, spectral centroid, and rhythmic properties, the model categorizes music with precision and helps in enhancing personalized recommendations, playlist curation, and trend analysis in the music industry.|
| üé§ [YouTube Sentiment Analysis for Comments](https://github.com/RaghaviRajumohan/Rhythms-of-Data/tree/main/Youtube_Comments_Sentiment_Analysis) | This project uses natural language processing to assess sentiment in YouTube comments on Doechii's music videos. Sentiment scores were integrated into a regression model to predict view counts, analyzing the relationship between audience sentiment and video performance metrics. The YouTube API was used to collect data on comments, likes, views, and other engagement metrics directly from Doechii's official YouTube channel.|
| üìä [Music API Data Extraction](https://github.com/RaghaviRajumohan/Rhythms-of-Data/tree/main/Music_API_data_extraction) | This project integrates multiple APIs, including Spotify, Genius,YouTube, Discogs, and Ticketmaster, to create specialized datasets tailored to key research questions in the music industry. By structuring artist, streaming, sentiment, and event data, it enables trend analysis and data-driven insights for artist management and marketing.|
| ‚òÅÔ∏è [Google Automation for Music Metrics](https://github.com/RaghaviRajumohan/Rhythms-of-Data/tree/main/Cloud_Automated_Music_Metrics) | This project automates the extraction, processing, and storage of music industry performance metrics using Google Cloud. It integrates YouTube and Spotify APIs to streamline data collection, automatically storing data in Google Sheets for centralized, real-time access, enabling efficient tracking of artist performance and audience engagement.|
| üéπ [Streams Prediction Calculator](https://github.com/RaghaviRajumohan/Rhythms-of-Data/tree/main/Streams_Prediction_Calculator) | This project provides an interactive widget-based interface for predicting music streaming numbers in real time. By leveraging a regression model hosted in the cloud, it enables users to input song features such as energy, danceability, and engagement metrics to receive instant predictions. The tool integrates cloud functions and interactive widgets for a seamless user experience. |
